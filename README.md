# GenBank-to-GBFF
Combines .gb files that contain single sequence records and outputs as a concatenated single file in .gbff format. In the gbff file, records are not simply concatenated by sorted by decreasing order of size. Typically gbff file represents the complete genome of an organism. For example, for a bacterial genome, a gbff file would contain the complete circular genome and any plasmid sequences the organism may contain.
